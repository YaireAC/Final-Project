Final CS 162

In this design, we can perform a few games for users to play. Through the main file, first.py, this file is the first to open for users to interact with. It is, in simple words, the introductory wedge. Opening them options on which game they wish to play. In doing so, once they click their option, another wedge opens by the game chosen. 

In total, there are three other classes, one for each Option game. A Love Calculator, A Love Note maker, and a Factorial Calculator.
